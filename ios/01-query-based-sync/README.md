# Realm Cloud ToDo List - iOS

This is a complement to the Realm Cloud _ToDo List_ tutorial https://docs.realm.io/cloud/ios-todo-app

## Requirements:

1. [XCode 9.2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
2. [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) 1.2.x or higher

## Setup

1. **Important:** This project uses the deprecated [nickname authentication provider](https://docs.realm.io/server/configure/authentication/nickname-authentication), which you must opt-in to use. To opt in,
   - Log in to https://cloud.realm.io.
   - Select your instance.
   - Go to the "Settings" tab.
   - Under "Authentication", click to expand "Nickname".
   - Click "Enable" and accept the prompt.

If you forget to enable nickname authentication and run the app anyway, you will see the following fatal error: "Your request parameters did not validate. provider: Invalid parameter 'provider'!".

Please note that the nickname authentication provider is only intended for development purposes. If you intend to use the same instance for production, you should disable the nickname authentication provider after you are done with this sample app.

2. In a new terminal window, run `pod install --repo-update` to update and install the required Realm SDK.
3. Open `ToDo.xcworkspace` with Xcode.
4. Locate the `Constants.swift` file in the file navigator; Edit it and replace `MY_INSTANCE_ADDRESS` with your Cloud Instance Address.
5. Select a simulator from the Xcode tool bar (see figure 1).
6. Run the project by pressing the run button on the tool bar.
